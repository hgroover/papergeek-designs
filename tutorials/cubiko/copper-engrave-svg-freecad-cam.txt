Engraving svg using FreeCAD CAM workbench

Inkscape
1. Save a copy of your original
2. Delete ALL layers and objects which are not intended for engraving.
3. Convert all text objects to paths (select text object, Path / Object to path)
4. Turn off fill for all objects and set stroke paint to any visible color. Fill doesn't matter
5. Set stroke style to 1px width (width won't matter)

1. Start FreeCAD 1.0.2
2. Switch to Draft workbench, top view
3. Import svg file (use Inkscape svg, make sure any layers you don't want have been DELETED first - save a copy if you have to)
4. Select import svg as geometry
5. Select objects (there will be many) in logical groups and use Modify / Draft to sketch. Delete each group of objects after converting them
5b. Switch to sketch, create new sketch. From 0,0 create two bounding boxes in one sketch, one for the total workpiece, another for the accessible
    work area (excluding clamps)
6. Switch to CAM
7. Create job with sketches sketches selected (which will not be in the right place)
8. After creating job, go to Job/Model and apply position and scaling
9. Select each element or group of elements under Model for engraving then click Engraving
10. Set start depth, end depth (negative), then step (absolute)
11. Set safe height and clearance height
12. Repeat 9-11 as needed to create multiple engrave operations
13. Select job, then Cam / Cam simulator
14. Cancel simulator when done
15. Select Job then post process and save gcode

16. Open FreeCAD output gcode, verify appearance and original
17. Mount stock, verify correct bit is installed, lug should be firmly attached to stock and alligator clip should be attached to bit
    On machine's control panel, go to Calibration / Height map and make sure the switch button at the bottom is NOT turned on. This should
	not be on unless you previously created a height map from the control panel. To the left means off, to the right means on.
18. Zero XY at lower left
19. Create heightmap
20. Border should be already set to the extent of the gcode model. If not, click auto
21. Set origin to (more or less) the center of your piece
22. Click Origin to move to the origin then probe Z to zero Z
23. Set probe gride X and Y to 16 and 16. Zt can be lower, something like 0.6 to save time on the probe. F should be lower than the default, perhaps 6
24. Set interpolation grid to 96x96 (if using 100x100mm piece with some margin, this will give you about 1mm resolution)
25. Click origin to go to the center you selected. Run Z probe one last time. This probe at the center will be the reference point 
    used for the height map.
26. Now start Probe. This will first probe at the origin position you've set then will move to the start of the border and begin 
    probing the grid. Expect it to take around 30 minutes.
27. If the bit crashes you may not have the leads connected properly.
28. Inspect the probe results. If there is a really large variance there may be a problem with the way the piece is secured, or 
    some conductive debris
29. If all looks good, click Edit to finish "editing" the heightmap, then make sure the "Use heightmap" is checked
30. With "Use heightmap" checked, all of your gcode as displayed will be slightly modified, with additional points added.
31. Remove the alligator clip before starting!
32. Start by clicking Send

Outcomes:
20-deg v-bit - apparently broke, most in air
rb5 - 0.1 too wide for script F100 F10
rb12 - trying 0.08 with F100 F10 - worse than rb5
rb15 - trying 0.08 with F100 F10 - slightly better than rb5
Waiting for new V-bits
